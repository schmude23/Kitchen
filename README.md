How to build and run application:

Import all files into Android Studio with an emulator of Android 4.0 or higher. Run the application through Android Studio to launch the emulator and the app. Once launched, mouse clicks act as though you are touching the phone screen. For entering text, you may use either the android keyboard or the computer keyboard. Our suggested virtual device is a Google Nexus 5x.

How to build and run tests:

In the iteration 2 branch under app/src/androidTest there is the It2_DatabaseTester file. Right click on the file and run to run automated tests.
